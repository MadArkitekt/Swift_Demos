<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Exo;">The following apps demo Swift, as well as the expanded capabilities of Xcode 11</p>

# SwiftUI
## Build Sheets
### BullsEye
* Uses SwiftUI w/UIKit

### MacBullsEye
* SwiftUI on macOS and iPadOS

### Packages
* Swift Packages of the game thus far

### RGBullsEye
* SwiftUI demo app
* Original app's capabilities then expanded upon
* Uses UIKit w/SwiftUI 

### TVBullsEye
* SwiftUI on AppleTV

### Notes
* Declarative app development
    * declare how views should look and what data they depend on
    * declare how view's state affects its appearance & how SwiftUI should react to change in data dependencies 
* Essentially a *reactive* UI
* Help speed up app development
    * **Views**
        * Declarative UI doesn't need stringly-typed identifiers to stay in sync with code
        * use views 4 layout and navigation and encapsulate presentation logic for a specific piece of data
        * API consistent across platforms
        * Controls describe their role not appearance - same control looks appropriate for every platform 
    * **Data**
        * Declarative data dependencies update views upon data change - the framework recomputes the views and all their children, then renders what has changed
        * View's state depends on its data => declare *how* view uses data, how view reacts to data changes, or how data affects the view
        * Declare possible states for view and how view appears in each state 
    * **Navigation**
        * Conditional subviews *can* replace navigation
    * **Integration**
        * Easy to integrate SwiftUI into UIKit app and vice versa
    * SwiftUI manages dependencies to keep views consistent with their state => don't have to worry about doing things in the right order or forgetting to update a UI object
    * Canvas means no need for storyboard 
    * Subviews keep selves updated means no need for view controller
    * Live preview means not as much a need for simulator

<h3 style="font-family:Exo-Thin">AdaptiveWeather</h3>
AdaptiveWeatherâ€™s two views are truly universal, scaling to any device and transitioning from a vertical stack, to horizontal row depending on orientation. No code alteration necessary, results were achieved purely through Storyboard.

* Adaptive Layout

* Adaptive Font

* Device-Dependent Images (Including Retina HD images for iPhone 6 Plus)

### Audio Session / EZAudio / CocoaPods Code is Up - Tutorial in Progress

* Measuring incoming audio levels using AVAudioSession while simultaneously drawing a waveform using [EZAudio](https://github.com/MadArkitekt/EZAudio)

  * _A tutorial explaining the previous will be available at [techEd](http://edsaltertech.com)_

# Data Structures & Algorithms
## Data Structures:
### Stack
* **LIFO** 
* Essential operations
    - **push**
    - **pop**
