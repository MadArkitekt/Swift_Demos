#Build Sheet

##CoreDataTest
* CoreData (shocker I know)
* _Actual Shocker_ Made using... rrriigghhtt the NDA with Apple - Need to check that first before I go further, regarding explanations (I'd rather be careful than have my Apple Dev license revoked :] - Yes, I do know apple has a blog about the language, but I'm not sure about the NDA's stipulations regarding _functional apps_ )
* Though there are some _comments_ I made in the app, take a look
